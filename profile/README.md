# Rowtype Yoga 🧘🏽‍♂️🧘‍♀️🧘🏿

Open anarcho type-level collective. We develop clean, typesafe and simple libraries for PureScript.

Anybody can join us. Especially library maintainers. As a collective we distribute the maintenance burden among each other.
Just write us on the [PureScript Discord Chat](https://purescript.org/chat).

## Web
* 💌 [fetch](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-fetch) - A minimalist library for using fetch (aka browser http client) in PureScript
* 👔 [yoga-json](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-yoga-json) - An easy-to-use yet powerful JSON de-/serialisation library. Originally forked from [`simple-json`](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-simple-json) with a lot of new additions
* 🐝 [web-proletarian](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-web-proletarian) - Small bindings and instructions how to use web-workers in PureScript with modern bundlers

## Data types
* 📀 [record-studio](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-record-studio) - Working with records made easy
* 🎄 [yoga-tree](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-yoga-tree) - A data type for representing trees with arbitrary number of children and handy zippers
* 🕉️ [yoga-om](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-yoga-om) - A powerful general purpose type for writing applications. Includes dependency injection via `Reader`, error `Variant`s and of course `Aff`
* 🧟‍♂️ [yoga-variation](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-yoga-variation) - Variant? Validation? Why not both? This lib combines [`variant`](https://github.com/natefaubion/purescript-variant) and [`validation`](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-validation)
* 💍 [untagged-union](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-untagged-union) - A data type for untagged unions

## Databases
* 💾 [yoga-postgres](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-yoga-postgres) - `node-postgres` FFI bindings, originally forked from [`purescript-node-postgres`](https://github.com/epost/purescript-node-postgres)

## React
We extensively use react and created a couple of libraries to make PureScript work with react:
* 📜 [react-virtuoso](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-react-virtuoso) - PureScript FFI bindings for [`react-virtuoso`](https://virtuoso.dev/) virtualised-list library
* 💨 [fahrtwind](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-fahrtwind) - [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/)-based CSS building blocks heavily inspired by [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* 📖 [react-basic-storybook](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-react-basic-storybook) - PureScript FFI bindings for [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
* ⏭️ [nextjs](http://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-nextjs) - PureScript FFI bindings for [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/)
* 💅🏽 [nextui](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/purescript-nextui) - PureScript FFI bindings for [NextUI](https://nextui.org/)

# Others
* 🤖 [royo](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/royo) - Our PureScript compile bot for Discord

# Deprecated
* 🖋 [pose](https://github.com/rowtype-yoga/pose) - Purescript code formatter. Use [tidy](https://github.com/natefaubion/purescript-tidy) instead
